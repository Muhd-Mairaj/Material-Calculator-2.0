# ordered set in python

--> "In Python 3.6 and later, the built-in dict type is inherently ordered.
    If you ignore the dictionary values, that also gives you a simple ordered set,
    with fast O(1) insertion, deletion, iteration and membership testing.
    However, dict does not provide the list-like random access features of OrderedSet.
    You would have to convert it to a list in O(N) to look up the index of an entry
    or look up an entry by its index."
